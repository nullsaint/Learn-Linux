    <h3 style="color:teal;">ubuntu |oǒ'boǒntoō|</h3>
    <p>Ubuntu is an ancient African word meaning 'humanity' to others;.   It also means ' I am what I am because of who we all are '. The Ubuntu   operating system brings the spirit of Ubuntu to the world of computers.</p>
    <h3 style="border-bottom:2px solid;color:teal;">Where did it all begin?</h3>
    <p>Linux was already established as an enterprise server platform   in 2004, but free software was not a part of everyday life for most   computer users. That's why Mark Shuttleworth gathered a small team of   developers from one of the most established Linux projects — Debian —   and set out to create an easy-to-use Linux desktop: Ubuntu.</p>
    <p>The vision for Ubuntu is part social and part economic: free   software, available to everybody on the same terms, and funded through a   portfolio of services provided by Canonical.</p>
  
 
<h3 style="color:teal; border-bottom:2px solid;">Ubuntu releases</h3>
<p>The Ubuntu team broke new ground in committing to a programme   of scheduled releases on a predictable six-month basis. It was decided   that every fourth release, issued on a two-year basis, would receive   long-term support (LTS). LTS releases are typically used for large-scale   deployments.</p>
<p>Ubuntu is different from the commercial Linux offerings that   preceded it because it doesn&rsquo;t divide its efforts between a high-quality   commercial version and a free &lsquo;community&rsquo; version. The commercial and   community teams collaborate to produce a single, high-quality release,   which receives ongoing maintenance for a defined period. Both the   release and ongoing updates are freely available to all users.</p>
<h3 style="color:teal; border-bottom:2px solid;">Governance</h3>
<p>The first official Ubuntu release — Version 4.10, codenamed the 'Warty Warthog' — was launched in October 2004, and sparked dramatic   global interest as thousands of free software enthusiasts and experts   joined the Ubuntu community.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/governance">The governance</a> of Ubuntu is somewhat independent of Canonical, with volunteer leaders   from around the world taking responsibility for many critical elements   of the project. It remains a key tenet of the Ubuntu Project that Ubuntu   is a shared work between Canonical, other companies, and the thousands   of volunteers who bring their expertise to bear on making it a   world-class platform for anyone to use.
