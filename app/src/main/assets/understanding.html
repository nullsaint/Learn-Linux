<ol>
    <li><strong>Shell</strong>: A Command-Line Interpretor that connects a user to <strong>Operating System</strong> and allows to execute the commands or by creating text script.</li>&nbsp;
    <li><strong>Process</strong>: Any task that a user run in the system is called a process. A process is little more complex than just a task.</li>&nbsp;
    <li><strong>File</strong>: It resides on hard disk (<strong>hdd</strong>) and contains data owned by a <strong>user</strong>.</li>&nbsp;
    <li><strong>X-windows aka windows</strong>: A mode of Linux where screen (<strong>monitor</strong>) can be split in small &#8220;<strong>parts</strong>&#8221; called <strong>windows</strong>, that allow a <strong>user</strong> to do several things at the same time and/or switch from one task to another easily and view graphics in a nice way.</li>&nbsp;
    <li><strong>Text terminal</strong>: A monitor that has only the capability of displaying text stuff, no graphics or a very basic graphics display.</li>&nbsp;
    <li><strong>Session</strong>: Time between <strong>logging</strong> <strong>on</strong> and <strong>logging out</strong> of the system.</li>&nbsp;

<h3 style="color:white;">Types of Shell on a Standard Linux Distribution</h3></div>
<p><strong>Bourne shell</strong> : The Bourne shell was one of the major shells used in early versions and became a de facto standard. It was written by <strong>Stephen Bourne</strong> at <strong>Bell Labs</strong>. Every Unix-like system has at least one shell compatible with the Bourne shell. The Bourne shell program name is &#8220;<strong>sh</strong>&#8221; and it is typically located in the file system hierarchy at <strong>/bin/sh</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>C shell</strong>: The <strong>C shell</strong> was developed by <strong>Bill Joy</strong> for the <strong>Berkeley Software Distribution</strong>. Its syntax is modelled after the <strong>C</strong> programming language. It is used primarily for interactive terminal use, but less frequently for scripting and operating system control. <strong>C</strong> shell has many interactive commands.</p>
