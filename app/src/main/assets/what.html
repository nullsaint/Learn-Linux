    <h2 style="color:white"> The benefits of Linux</h2></div>

<p>Linux now enjoys popularity at its prime and it's famous among programmers as well as regular computer users around the world. Its main benefits are -
    It offers a free operating system. You do not have to shell hundreds of dollars to get the OS like Windows! </p>



<p><b>1. </b> Being open-source, anyone with programming knowledge can modify it.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> The Linux operating systems now offer millions of programs/applications to choose from, most of them free!</p>
<p><b>3. </b> Once you have Linux installed you no longer need an antivirus! Linux is a highly secure system. More so , there is a global development community constantly looking at ways to enhance its security. With each upgrade, the OS becomes more secure and robust</p>
<p><b>4. </b> Linux is the OS of choice for Server environments due to its stability and reliability (Mega-companies like Amazon, Facebook ,and Google use Linux for their Servers). A Linux based server could run non-stop without a reboot for years on end.</p>

<p>Users, who are new to Linux, usually shun it by falsely considering it as a difficult and technical
    OS to operate but, to state the truth, in the last few years Linux operating systems have become
    a lot more user-friendly than their counterparts like Windows<strong>,</strong> so trying them
    is the best way to know whether Linux suits you or not.
<p>There are <strong>thousands of Linux based operating systems;</strong> most of them offer <strong>state-of-the-art security and applications</strong>,<strong> all of it for free!</strong>
<p>This is what Linux is all about, and now we will move on to how to install Linux and which
    Distribution you should choose.

    <h2 style="color:white;">I am asked to Learn Unix? Then why Linux?</h2></div>
<p>UNIX is called the mother of operating systems which laid out the foundation to Linux. Unix is designed mainly for mainframes and is in enterprises and universities .While Linux is fast becoming a household name for computer users , developers and server environment. You may have to pay for a Unix kernel while in Linux it is free.</p>

<p>But, the commands used on both the operating systems are usually the same. There is not much difference between UNIX and Linux. Though they might seem different, at core, they are essentially the same. Since, Linux is a clone of UNIX.Â So learning one is same as learning another</p>
