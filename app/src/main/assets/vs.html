    <h2 style="color:white;"> Linux Vs Windows </h2></div>

<p>Now, that you have installed Linux, it's time to make the big switch from your Windows or Max OS operating system.
<p>Mac OS uses a UNIX core. Your switch from Mac OS to Linux will be relatively smooth.
<p>It's the Windows users who will need some adjusting.&nbsp; &nbsp;In this tutorial will be introduce the Linux OS and compare it with Windows.

<p>Linux File System

<p>In Microsoft Windows, files are stored in folders under different data drives like C: D: E: .
<p>But, in&nbsp;<strong>Linux, files are ordered in a tree structure starting with the root directory</strong>.
<p>&nbsp;This root directory can be considered as the start of the file system and it further branches out various other subdirectories. The root
    is denoted with a forward slash '/'.
<p>A general tree file system on your UNIX may look like this.

<h2 style="color:teal;border-bottom: 3px solid gray;"> Types of Files</h2>
<p>In Linux and UNIX, everything is a file. Directories are files, files are files, and devices like Printer, mouse, keyboard etc.are
    files.
<p>Let's look into the File types in more detail '
<h3 style="color:teal;border-bottom: 3px solid gray;"> <strong>General Files</strong></h3>
<p>General Files also called as Ordinary files. They can contain image, video, program or simply text. They can be in ASCII or
    a Binary format. These are the most commonly &nbsp;used files by Linux Users
<h3 style="color:teal;border-bottom: 3px solid gray;"> &nbsp;<strong>Directory Files</strong></h3>
<p> <strong>&nbsp;</strong>These files are a warehouse for other file types. You can have a directory file within a directory
    (sub-directory).You can take them as&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Folders' found in Windows operating system.
<h3  style="color:teal;border-bottom: 3px solid gray;"> &nbsp;<strong>Device Files:</strong></h3>
<p>In MS Windows, devices like Printers, CD-ROM and hard drives are represented as drive letters like G: H:. In Linux,
    there are represented as files.&nbsp; &nbsp;For example, if the first SATA hard drive had three primary partitions,
    they would be named and numbered as /dev/s<em>da1</em>, /dev/sda2 and /dev/sda3.

<p> <strong>Note</strong>: All device files reside in the directory /dev/
<p>All the above file types (including devices) have permissions, which allow a user to read, edit or execute
    (run) them. This is a powerful Linux/Unix feature. Access restrictions can be applied for different kinds
    of users, by changing permissions.
<h2 style="color:teal; border-bottom: 3px solid gray;"> Users in Linux</h2>
<p>There are 3 types of users in Linux
<ol>
    <li>Regular</li>
    <li>Administrative(root)</li>
    <li>Service</li>
</ol>
<h3 style="color:teal;border-bottom: 3px solid gray;"> Regular User</h3>
<p>A regular user account is created for you when you install Ubuntu on your system. All your files and
    folders are stored in /home/
    which is your home directory. As a regular user, you do not have access to directories of other
    users.
<h3 style="color:teal;border-bottom: 3px solid gray;"> Root User</h3>
<p>Other than your regular account another user account called root is created at the time of installation.&nbsp;
    The root account is a <strong>super user</strong> who can access restricted files, install software
    and has administrative privileges. Whenever you want to install software, make changes to system
    files or perform any administrative task on Linux; you need to log in as a root user. Otherwise,
    for general tasks like playing music and browsing the internet you can use your regular account.
<h3 style="color:teal;border-bottom: 3px solid gray;"> Service user</h3>
<p>Linux is widely used as a Server Operating System. Services such as Apache,
    Squid, mail, etc. have their own&nbsp;individual&nbsp;service accounts. &nbsp;Having service
    accounts increases security of your computer. Linux can allow or deny access to various resources depending on the service.
<p>Note:
<ol>
    <li style="margin-left: 0.5in; ">&nbsp;You will not see service accounts in Ubuntu Desktop version.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 0.5in; ">&nbsp;Regular accounts are called standard accounts in Ubuntu Desktop</li>
</ol>
<h2 style="color:teal; border-bottom: 3px solid gray;"> File Name Convention</h2>
<p>&nbsp;In Windows, you cannot have 2 files with the same name in the same folder. See
    below -
<p style="text-align: center; ">
    <img width="100%" src=img/WindowsError.png />
    </p>
<p>While in Linux, you can have 2 files with the same name in the same directory,
    provided they use different cases.
<p style="text-align: center; ">
    <img width="100%" src=img/LinuxFileNaming.png />
<h2 style="color:teal; border-bottom: 3px solid gray;"> The HOME Directory</h2>
<p>For every user in Linux, a directory is created as <strong>/home/</strong>
<p>Consider, a regular user account "Tom". He can store his personal
    files and directories in the directory "/home/tom". He can't
    save files outside his user directory and does not have access
    to directories of other users. For instance, he cannot access
    directory "/home/jerry" of another user account"Jerry".
<p>The concept is the similar to C:\Documents and Settings in
    Windows.
<p>When you boot the Linux operating system, your user directory
    (from the above example /home/tom) is the <strong>default working directory</strong>.
    Hence the directory "/home/tom is also called the <strong>Home directory</strong> which
    is a misnomer.
<p>The working directory can be changed using some commands
    which we will learn later.
<h3 style="color:teal; border-bottom: 3px solid gray;"> <strong>Other Directories</strong></h3>
<p>In Windows, System and Program files are usually
    saved in C: drive. But, in Linux you would
    find the system and program files in different
    directories. For example, the boot files are
    stored in the /boot directory and program and
    software files can be found under /bin , device
    files in /dev. Below are important Linux Directories
    and short description of what they contain.
    &nbsp;
<p style="text-align: center; ">
    <img width="100%" src="img/LinuxDirectories.png" />
<p>These are most striking differences between
    Linux and other Operating Systems.&nbsp;
    There are more variations you will
    observe when switching to Linux and
    we will discuss them as we move along
    in our tutorials.
