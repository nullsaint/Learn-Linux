    <p>Next is the installation type, this installation on the fresh HDD so i got only two option in the installation type. Depend upon the other OS on your HDD you will get more options. Please chose any one method.

        1. Erase disk and install Ubuntu (i.e. it will format the entire drive and install the OS). If you don’t have any idea about the partitioning scheme simply click continue.</p>

Pop up will ask you to confirm, click on continue.</p>
