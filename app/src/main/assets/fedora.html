<h1 style="border-bottom:2px solid;color:#03A9F4">Fedora</h1>
<p>It is hard to conclude which side of Fedora is more popular to the <a href="https://www.ntchosting.com/internet/" title="Internet">Internet</a> audience – the fact that it is a powerful free operating system based on the <a href="https://www.ntchosting.com/linux-operating-system.html" title="Linux">Linux</a> kernel, or that it represents a whole new concept in the distribution   of open-source software where the global community of supporters plays a   fundamental role.</p>
<p>First and foremost, Fedora is a Linux-based operating system created   back in 2003 as a community distribution called the Fedora Project. It   was released along with Red Hat Enterprise Linux, which was to be the   next official Linux distribution after Red Hat Linux was discontinued.   Its main purpose was to serve as a source of software innovations for   the Hat Enterprise Linux releases. This connection between the two Linux   distributions explains the origin of the Fedora name – 'fedora' refers   to the characteristic fedora hat used in Red Hat's "Shadowman" logo</p>
<h2 style="border-bottom:2px double; border-top:2px double;color:#03A9F4 ">Fedora releases</h2>
<p>The first set of Fedora releases, known as Fedora Core 1-4, was   launched within the period 2003-2005, followed by the Fedora Core 5-6   set in 2006 and Fedora 7 in 2007. Those versions, however, are no longer   supported by the Fedora Project. The following Fedora versions – Fedora   8 (introduced in 2007), Fedora 9 (released in the spring of 2008) and   Fedora 10 (launched at the end of 2008), are all officially supported by   the Fedora project. The latest of them – Fedora 10, code named   'Cambridge', features a whole new set of innovative characteristics such   as a new 'Solar' artwork, faster startup with Plymouth, web-based   packages installer, ext4 filesystem support, Sugar Desktop Environment   and many others.</p>
<h2 style="border-bottom:2px solid;border-top:2px solid;color:#03A9F4">Fedora and security</h2>
<p>Just as all Linux distributions, Fedora is focused on security.   Unlike Ubuntu, which is another very popular Linux distribution based on   Debian, in Fedora a firewall is present right from the start and can be   easily configured both using the terminal or via the graphical   interface. Fedora also is one of the main promoters for SELinux, which   stands for Security-Enhanced Linux, a feature which implements several   security policies, which are missing in most of the Linux-based   distributions. Additionally, Fedora comes with several custom security   enhancements, which derive from its connection with Red Hat's Enterprise   Linux. This makes Fedora a very popular choice for <a href="https://www.ntchosting.com/apache-web-server.html" title="Web servers">web servers</a>.   Fedora is also the OS of choice for Linus Torvalds, the creator of the   Linux kernel, and is used as the operating system for several NASA   systems and supercomputers, such as the Roadrunner.</p>
